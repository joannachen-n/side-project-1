BASEPROMPT:

I'm building a Flappy Bird-style game using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I‚Äôm a beginner and using Cursor to learn as I go. I want this game to feel like it was designed by a top-tier Pentagram designer ‚Äî simple, clean, polished, and humorous.

Please help me set up the basic structure with explanations in comments:
1. `index.html` ‚Äî includes a canvas where the game will be rendered.
2. `style.css` ‚Äî centers the canvas, sets the background to sky blue, and makes the layout responsive.
3. `script.js` ‚Äî should:
   - Draw a yellow bird (circle or temporary placeholder).
   - Use gravity to make the bird fall.
   - Let the bird jump on spacebar or screen tap.
   - Animate using `requestAnimationFrame`.

Once this works, I‚Äôll ask for help adding pipes, score tracking, and a game over modal.

Keep it well-commented and modular so I can customize it later with my own Figma assets.

üß© 1. Prompt to Add Pipes and Collision Detection
Now that I have a working bird that falls and flaps using spacebar or touch, I want to add pipes and basic game logic.

Please update my `script.js` to include:
- Pipes that spawn at regular intervals (every 1.5‚Äì2 seconds).
- Each pipe pair should have a randomized vertical gap.
- Pipes should scroll from right to left.
- Detect collision between the bird and the pipes or top/bottom of the screen.
- If a collision happens, show a game over state (e.g. console log or alert for now).
- Clean code structure with comments so I can later animate the pipes or use Figma designs instead of rectangles.

Keep the logic simple and beginner-friendly. I'd like to style and design the pipes later using Figma, so use placeholder rectangles for now.

üß© 1.2 Score tracking, gameover modal, home screen, instructions
I want to build out additional features in my Flappy Bird‚Äìstyle browser game.

Please help me implement the following features using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

1. **Score Tracking:**
   - Keep track of the number of pipes the player successfully passes.
   - Display the current score on the top-left or top-center of the game while it‚Äôs running.

2. **Game Over Modal:**
   - When the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, display a modal overlay.
   - The modal should show:
     - Final score
     - ‚ÄúPlay Again‚Äù button
   - Clicking ‚ÄúPlay Again‚Äù should reset the game (score, pipe positions, bird position, etc.).

3. **Home Screen:**
   - When the page loads, show a "Home" screen before the game starts.
   - The Home screen should include:
     - A title or logo for the game
     - Short instructions: ‚ÄúPress spacebar or tap to flap. Avoid the pipes!‚Äù
     - A ‚ÄúStart Game‚Äù button

4. **Transitions Between Screens:**
   - Hide the home screen when the game starts.
   - Show the game canvas while playing.
   - Show the Game Over modal on loss.
   - Allow restarting by going back into the game loop cleanly.

Keep the code modular and add helpful comments so I can style or enhance each part later using my own Figma designs. Make sure everything works on both desktop and mobile.


üñºÔ∏è 2. Prompt to Replace Circle with Bird Image (Figma Export)
I‚Äôve exported a custom bird image from Figma called `bird.png` and placed it in my project folder.

Please help me update `script.js` so that instead of drawing a circle, it draws my bird image (`bird.png`) on the canvas. The bird should:
- Be centered where the circle used to be.
- Scale appropriately (e.g. around 40x40 pixels).
- Maintain the same gravity and jump behavior as before.

Also let me know how to preload the image so the game doesn‚Äôt break if it loads slowly.
